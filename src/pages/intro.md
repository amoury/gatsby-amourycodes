I transitioned my career into the web as a <span class="green-highlight">UI/UX designer</span> but I soon found curiosity for coding. This curiosity led me on the journey to explore the world of coding and since then I have been hooked.

I love learning and working with latest technologies if they improve the <span class="green-highlight">user experience</span> and make the web a better place. 

I am <span class="green-highlight">looking to join</span> the team of talented developers on a full time basis, that are working towards changing the world.
