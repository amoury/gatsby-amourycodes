I transitioned my career into the web as a <span class="green-highlight">UI/UX designer</span> but I soon found curiosity for coding. This curiosity led me on the journey to explore the world of coding and since then I have been hooked.

I love learning and working with latest technologies if they improve the <span class="green-highlight">user experience</span> and make the web a better place. 

I am currently enjoying my role as a <span class="green-highlight">Frontend Engineer at Namshi.com</span> and learning a great deal on a daily basis from a bunch of talented engineers.
